# Illumio Challenge - Simple Firewall 
##**Goal**:
> Given a set of firewall rules, a network packet will be accepted by the firewall if and only if the
direction, protocol, port, and IP address match at least one of the input rules. If a rule contains
a port range, it will match all packets whose port falls within the range. If a rule contains an IP
address range, it will match all packets whose IP address falls within the range.
